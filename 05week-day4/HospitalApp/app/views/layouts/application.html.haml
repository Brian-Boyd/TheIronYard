            %h5 Breakout of Spattergroit
          %p In the news today, doctors have confirmed a major breakout of Spattergroit, a disease that covers the victim in purple pustules and renders them unable to speak. The only known cure, according to the portrait of a Healer in St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries, is to bind the liver of a toad around the victim's throat and stand nude in a barrel of eel's eyes under a full moon.
